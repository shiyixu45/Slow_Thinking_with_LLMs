### OlymMATH: Challenging the Boundaries of Reasoning: An Olympiad-Level Math Benchmark for Large Language Models [[Report]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.21380)

- 🧮 We introduce **OlymMATH**, a meticulously curated benchmark of **200 high-quality Olympiad-level** math problems spanning algebra, geometry, number theory, and combinatorics.

- 🌐 Our benchmark features fully parallel English and Chinese problem sets (**OlymMATH-EN** and **OlymMATH-ZH**), enabling comprehensive multilingual evaluation of mathematical reasoning capabilities.

- 📊 OlymMATH is strategically divided into two difficulty levels:
The **EASY** subset closely aligns with AIME-level difficulty, providing an effective evaluation for standard reasoning approaches
The **HARD** subset is specifically designed to challenge state-of-the-art reasoning models, pushing the boundaries of their capabilities.

- 🔍 Our experiments reveal that even the most advanced models struggle with OlymMATH-HARD, highlighting significant room for improvement in mathematical reasoning.

- 🧠 We observe that LLMs often resort to empirical **guessing** rather than rigorous reasoning, using pattern matching, heuristic methods, or proposition simplification to arrive at answers without systematic derivation. OlymMATH-HARD effectively challenges these "shortcut" approaches, as its complex problems require deeper mathematical understanding.

### R1-Searcher: Incentivizing the Search Capability in LLMs via Reinforcement Learning [[Report]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.05592)

- The core motivation lies in incentivizing the search capabilities of large language models (LLMs) by enabling exploration within an external retrieval environment. A two-stage outcome-based reinforcement learning (RL) framework is designed to guide the model in freely exploring how to invoke an external retrieval system for acquiring relevant information.
- The proposed methodology relies solely on outcome-based reinforcement learning, eliminating the need for distillation techniques or cold-start strategies based on supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Moreover, it is effective for both base models (zero-shot) and fine-tuned models.
- A modified RL training method is introduced, building on Reinforce++ with RAG-based rollout and retrieval mask-based loss calculation. The RAG-based rollout strategy enhances the model's ability to utilize retrieved information effectively during the reasoning process. Additionally, retrieval mask-based loss calculation ensures precise capture of the relevance of retrieved information during training while minimizing interference from irrelevant data.
- 🔥 Here are our model: [Qwen-2.5-7B-Base-RL](https://huggingface.co/XXsongLALA/Qwen-2.5-7B-base-RAG-RL) and [Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct-RL](https://huggingface.co/XXsongLALA/Llama-3.1-8B-instruct-RAG-RL), [code](https://github.com/RUCAIBox/R1-Searcher) and [data](https://huggingface.co/datasets/XXsongLALA/RAG-RL-Hotpotqa-with-2wiki/tree/main).

### STILL-3: An Empirical Study on Eliciting and Improving R1-like Reasoning Models [[Report]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.04548)


- The performance of large reasoning models is heavily influenced by the settings of RL.
  - We thoroughly investigate and document these effects by testing a range of parameter configurations. Following this, **we provide a recommendation for RL training**.
- After pre-training, the base models already exhibit the potential to perform individual complex reasoning actions. The RL process effectively activates this capability, enabling the model to integrate these actions into a coherent and deliberate thinking process.
  - Our RL training approach consistently improves the QWEN2.5-32B base model, enhancing both response length and test accuracy.
- Response length serves as an important indicator of the success of RL training; however, it is a consequence, not a cause, of performance improvement. Designing specialized reward functions to explicitly encourage the model to produce longer responses may lead to issues such as reward hacking, which can’t inherently enhance the model’s reasoning capabilities.
- RL training consistently improves the performance of fine-tuned models, encompassing both short and long CoT reasoning models.
  - Even after Qwen2.5-1.5B attains a high level of performance through training with distilled data, RL training further elevates its capabilities, **achieving a remarkable accuracy of 39.33 on AIME 2024** **(STILL-3-1.5B-Preview)**.
- Through supervised fine-tuning, LRMs can acquire the capability to manipulate external tools, leading to a significant enhancement in the model’s performance.
  - By effectively utilizing tool manipulation, **STILL-3-TOOL-32B achieves an impressive accuracy of 86.67 (greedy search) on AIME 2024**.
  - Remarkably, this ability can be **activated with only a small number of high-quality training instances**.
- We will soon open-source our model, code, and data.

- 🧑‍💻 We attempt to activate the **tool manipulation** capability of the long CoT thinking model, enabling it to **spontaneously generate code and call upon tools** to assist in the problem-solving process.
- 📈 To our surprise, we find that **_our approach outperform the comparative baseline models (such as DeepSeek-R1, o1, o3-mini-medium) on AIME 24_**, and **_its average performance across three math competitions was on par with DeepSeek-R1_**!
- 📝 We have detailed the training process, data construction, and case studies of STILL-3-Tool-32B in our [**Notion page**](https://lake-bayberry-173.notion.site/Empowering-Reasoning-Models-with-Wings-Tool-Manipulation-Significantly-Enhances-the-Reasoning-Abili-1a6ab1cf72428023a105c16eec90968e).

### 🚀 STILL-3-1.5B-Preview: A 1.5B slow-thinking reasoning model continuously evolving through RL.

+ To delve deeper into the potential of reinforcement learning, we applied this training method to the publicly released SFT model by DeepSeek, known as [DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B](deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B), which has enhanced by complex reasoning capacities.
+ Throughout the RL process, we noticed **a progressive expansion in both the training and test sets**. This led to a substantial enhancement in the model's reasoning skills, culminating in a 39.33% accuracy score on the American Invitational Mathematics Examination (AIME) leaderboard.
+ We are open-sourcing all of the relevant **[code](OpenRLHF-STILL) (based on [OpenRLHF](https://github.com/OpenRLHF/OpenRLHF)), [model](RUC-AIBOX/STILL-3-1.5B-preview), and [training data](RUC-AIBOX/STILL-3-Preview-RL-Data)** (30k from MATH,NuminaMathCoT, and AIME 1983-2023)  to foster further research and development in the field of reinforcement learning algorithms.

We evaluated the model on four benchmarks: MATH, AIME, OMNI, and LiveAOPS. For MATH and AIME, we employed a sampling decoding setup with a sampling temperature of 0.6 and a top-p sampling probability of 0.95. Each question was sampled 64 times, and the average score was calculated. For OMNI and LiveAOPS (August-November 2024), we randomly sampled a subset of answers as integers to facilitate automated evaluation, and used greedy search decoding for the evaluation. The trained model, STILL-3-1.5B-preview, achieved significant improvement. The accuracy on the AIME task increased from 28.67% to 39.33%, resulting in a relative improvement of 37.18%.

### 🚀 Imitate, Explore, and Self-Improve: A Reproduction Report on Slow-thinking Reasoning Systems [[Report]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.09413)

+ Slow-thinking reasoning systems, such as o1, have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in solving complex reasoning tasks, and are primarily developed and maintained by industry, with their core techniques not publicly disclosed. This paper presents a reproduction report on implementing o1-like reasoning systems. We introduce an **imitate, explore, and self-improve framework** as our primary technical approach to train the reasoning model. In the initial phase, we use distilled long-form thought data to fine-tune the reasoning model, enabling it to invoke a slow-thinking mode. The model is then encouraged to explore challenging problems by generating multiple rollouts, which can result in increasingly more high-quality trajectories that lead to correct answers. Furthermore, the model undergoes self-improvement by iteratively refining its training dataset.

### 🚀 Enhancing LLM Reasoning with Reward-guided Tree Search [[Report]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11694)

+ Recently, test-time scaling has garnered significant attention from the research community, largely due to the substantial advancements of the o1 model released by OpenAI. However,  develop an o1-like reasoning approach is challenging, and  researchers have been making various attempts to advance this open area of research. In this paper, we present a preliminary exploration into enhancing the reasoning abilities of  LLMs through **reward-guided tree search algorithms**. This framework is implemented by integrating the policy model, reward model, and search algorithm. It is primarily constructed around a tree search algorithm, where the policy model navigates a dynamically expanding tree guided by a specially trained reward model.

### 🚀 Think More, Hallucinate Less: Mitigating Hallucinations via Dual Process of Fast and Slow Thinking [[Report]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01306)

- Large language models demonstrate exceptional capabilities, yet still face the hallucination issue. We propose **HaluSearch**, a novel framework that incorporates tree search-based algorithms to enable an explicit slow thinking generation process for mitigating hallucinations of LLMs during inference. HaluSearch frames text generation as a step-by-step reasoning process, using a self-evaluation reward model to score each generation step and guide the tree search towards the most reliable generation pathway. To balance efficiency and quality, we introduce a hierarchical thinking system switch mechanism inspired by the dual process theory in cognitive science, which dynamically alternates between fast and slow thinking modes at both the instance and step levels.

### 🚀 Virgo: A Preliminary Exploration on Reproducing o1-like MLLM [[Report]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01904)

- There is a growing interest in reproducing o1-like MLLM in the research community. We explore a straightforward approach by fine-tuning a capable MLLM with a small amount of textual long-form thought data, resulting in a multimodal slow-thinking model, Virgo (**Vi**sual **r**easoning with lon**g** th**o**ught). We find that these long-form reasoning processes, expressed in natural language, can be effectively transferred to MLLMs. Moreover, it seems that such textual reasoning data can be even more effective than visual reasoning data in eliciting the slow-thinking capacities of MLLMs.

## Future Work

Despite the promising results, our exploration remains preliminary, and there is still a substantial capacity gap compared to industry-level systems. As future work, we plan to investigate how to scale our training approach and extend its capacity to more complex tasks.

As always, we are committed to keeping our technical approach *open*, and we will release the data, model, and other resources. We welcome collaboration and support in computational resources.
